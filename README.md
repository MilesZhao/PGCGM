## Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of generation code of PGCGM. If you want to run the code, you run it on `Colab`. The link is [PGCGM](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1m9RZIRoHaAQLNKxyiowHA8YMXgR86p5P#scrollTo=s50VQhHyUKkB). You need to make sure install the dependencies and then download folders of `data` and `models` and python scripts of `model.py` and `simle_dist.py` to your google drive in this [files](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LmQZ3HJXLXyhLiuFB4hFgylp_cSRGVwv).

### Running environment set up

we recommend that you build a virtural environment running the code. Below are steps that can install the dependent packages.
The installation has been tested under Ubuntu Linux with Nvidia 2080Ti and Nvidia 3090 GPUs.

#### Step1: Create conda virtual environment and activate it
```
conda create -n pgcgm python=3.7
conda activate pgcgm
```

use 'which' command to check folder of pip3 is located within the actual env ```pgcgm``` folder. It should be somewhere like if you are using miniconda: 
```
which pip3
~/miniconda3/envs/pgcgm/bin/pip3
```
or
```
$HOME/.conda/envs/pgcgm/bin/pip3
```


#### Step2: Then install following packages using:
```
pip3 install pymatgen==2022.0.6
pip3 install pickle5
```
Install `pytorch` from [pytorch web](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) based on your python & cuda version. For example,
For miniconda
```
pip3 install torch==1.7.1+cu110 torchvision==0.8.2+cu110 torchaudio==0.7.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```
If your machine has no GPU, use this:
```
pip3 install torch==1.7.1+cu110 torchvision==0.8.2+cpu torchaudio==0.7.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```


#### Step3: Once you install all those packages, you just run below commands to generate crystal structures:
```
git clone https://github.com/MilesZhao/PGCGM.git
cd PGCGM
./sh/gen.sh
```

Your generated cif files are located in the ternary_final_cifs folder
